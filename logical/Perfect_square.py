"""Given a positive number, check if it is a perfect square without using any built-in library function. A perfect square is a number that is the square of an integer.

Input: n = 25
Output: true
Explanation: 25 is a perfect square since it can be written as 5Ã—5.


Input: n = 20
Output: false
Explanation: 20 is not the product of an integer with itself."""
